**First Assigments**
Write a function that:
1. for two numbers taken from the keyboard, return their product.
2. will check if the given number is even.
3. will calculate the sum of squares of consecutive natural numbers smaller than the given value.
4. will check if the given number is prime.
5. will find the divisors of the given number.
6. will return the distribution of the given number into prime divisors.
7. will find the smallest common multiple of the given two numbers.
8. will represent the given number in binary form.
9. for given values of coefficients of a quadratic triangle will find its zero places.
10. for a given n will calculate n! . Give different solutions to this problem.
11. computes the nth Fibonacci number (n large).
12. for any number of arguments will return their cumulative partial sums.
13. for any number of numerical arguments will return their arithmetic mean.
14. for a given string will return a string with characters in reverse order.
15. for a given string will return how many uppercase and lowercase letters are in it.
16. for a given array will return an array with its unique elements.
17. for a given string will return a dictionary with statistics on the frequency of each character.
18. for a given string will return a list of words into which it can be divided.
19. for the given string will return its form in camel notation, e.g. for 'ala ma python' you will get 'alaMaPython'.
20. for a string in camel notation will return its "normal" form, e.g. for 'alaMaPython' we get 'ala has python'.
21. according to the Babylonian method will calculate the approximation of the square root of a given number.
22. approximates the value of Ï€ (Monte-Carlo method).
23. for the lists a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [4, 5, 6] will return the result c = [(1, 4),(2, 5),(3, 6)].
24. for a range of numbers range(100) will return a list of values that are divisible by 3 and indivisible by 5.
