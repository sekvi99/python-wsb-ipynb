# Bokeh and Plotly Visualization Procedures

## Plotting Sinus and Cosinus Functions

Create a procedure that utilizes the Bokeh and Plotly libraries to display a plot of the sinus and cosinus functions. Customize the plot with modifications to the axes, labels, legend, and other relevant features.

## Subplots of Polynomial Functions

Implement a procedure using Bokeh and Plotly to display subplots with the values of the functions \(f(x) = \{x, x^2, x^3, x^4\}\).

## Linear Function Plot with Slider

Develop a procedure that generates a plot of the linear function \(y = ax + b\) using the Bokeh and Plotly libraries. Utilize a Slider widget to allow dynamic adjustment of parameters \(a\) and \(b\) within the range [0,1]. You can refer to the Bokeh documentation, specifically the Slider example [here](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery/slider.html).

## Monte-Carlo Animation for π Approximation

Write a procedure that creates an animation to approximate the value of π using the Monte-Carlo method. This animation should provide a dynamic visualization of the Monte-Carlo process for estimating the value of π.
